# Variable Names

Rules for valid variable names (identifiers) :
- Name must begin with a letter or underscore ( _ ) and can be followed by any combination of letters, underscores, or digits.
- Key words cannot be used as a variable name.
- C is case-sensitive: sum, Sum, and SUM each refer to a different variable.
- Variable names can be as long as you want, although only the first 63 (or 31) characters might be significant.
- Choice of meaningful variable names can increase the readability of a program
