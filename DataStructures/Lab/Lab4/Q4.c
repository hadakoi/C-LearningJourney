/*
Use Pointers to structures and dynamic memory management functions in the following programs

Create a structure STUDENT consisting of variables of structures:
i.DOB {day, month (use pointer ), year},
ii.STU_INFO {reg_no, name(use pointer), address},
iii.COLLEGE {college_name (use pointer), university_name}
where structure types from i to iii are declared outside the STUDENT independently. 
Show how to read and display member variables of DOB type if pointer variable is created for DOB inside STUDENT and 
STUDENT variable is also a pointer variable. The program should read and display the values of all members of STUDENT structure.
